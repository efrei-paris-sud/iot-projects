Project Name : 21AF

2 in 1 Authentification factor

Nowdays, everyone is concerned by security. More commonly by it's password management, 
we're all having too much password, and as having one password for all our apps is not efficient, we're struggling. 
21AF is a little box connected to your PC, that helps you manage your password. Having your password on your pc isn't safe. 
We're creating here a local box with a little hard drive, which you can only acces by scanning your phone on it. 
It's using the Phone autentification factor without asking you to check an e-mail on it. 
The phone is starting the connection to the website by itself. 
We thougt this as a functionnal NFC reader/sender device, that checks for the phone validity before sending the request.
The website we can't to be connected to would be choosen on the phone, with a little User friendly app,
 and then the device would send the URL request and fill the username/password asked by the website.
 
This device would aim everyone using a personal computer on a daily.
Securing any device that way could be used by company to secure their working computer for those working in the cloud only,
with an nfc card instead of a phone doing the job. 
This device would let them connect to their online working station with their card/phone only, and be more secured.
