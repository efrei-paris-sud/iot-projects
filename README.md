# iot-projects

### Update Jan. 30
This repo did not get any pull-request, it is time to fill one for your project proposal!
* For those who have already created an `.md` file, create a pull-request as soon as possible! The reason is that we have to setup teams and repositories **where we will discuss the list of components and we will try to orient/re-orient your research by providing links or resources to begin with**.
* For those who did not create an `.md` file || do not have an idea || do not belong to a team, **do it as soon as possible** (the steps are below). 

### Upadate Jan. 18
#### Fresh news about the components
* The IoT course has at its disposal (both for the labs and projects)
  * Arduino Kits;
  * ESP32;
  * ZigBee modules;
  * LoRa modules;
* ZigBee modules should be interesting for those who are willing to work on some home automation stuff (short-range communications);
* LoRa modules are used for long-range communications. e.g. smart-cities, smart-farmes, etc.

#### About your ideas
Think about the four parts of IoT, i.e.:
* sensors / actuators;
* connectivity;
* application;
* and, platforms,

that your implementation must cover.

### Some resources (Will be updated regularly, so stay tuned) 
* [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ) is a video explaining how to make a contribution (a pull-request) to someone's repository;
* To get inspired, some readings about *Disney Reasearch* work [here](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/designing-groundless-body-channel-communication-systems/);

* **Update Jan. 18:**
  * For those who proposed monitoring eating habits, to get inspired, here are some screenshots from "*Auracle: Detecting Eating Episodes with an Ear-Mounted Sensor*" (Ubicomp 2018) which proposes an interesting solution

    (A connected cap is not a non-sense at all :wink:, it is the use-case that matters, and eventually where innovation lies!)
  * More generally, above papers and other cutting-edge research projects can be found in the program of the Ubiquitous computing conference (UbiComp) [Here](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2018/program/program.html).
  * **Important:**
    * Have fun while conceiving your ideas!
    * If you do have any question, ask it by filling an issue in this repo as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAPSbIHcDTw) and we (me or one of your classmates) will try to answer it.
  
## Project proposal
### Step 1
Fork this repository

### Step 2
After forking this repository, you will create a folder `team-name` where you will write a `team-name.md` MARKDOWN file (`team-name` being the name of your team).
Your file must contain the following PRELIMINARY components:
* Members of your team (name, email, github profile);
* Name of your IoT product;
* A description of your IoT product (A problematic you are targeting, your solution, market you are targeting, etc.). **A paragraph of about 200 words should be fine**;
* A preliminary list of components that you think appropriate;
* [Optional] Any document that you find related to your project. These have to be put under a folder `team-name/resources/`;

This first step is very important and require, from you, a little work of research. Try to get inspired by what is done currently in the market (FabLabs, CES 2019, etc.).

### Step 3
You have until Tuesday, January 22nd (23h59) to fill a **pull-request** containing your proposition in this repository.

### Step 4
An approval (or enhancement) will be issued by us.

### Step 5
We will create, for you, a repository in `Efrei-Paris-Sud - IoT` organization page.
We will follow your developments (commits, issues, discussions, etc.) and the more active you are, the more you get good appreciations for your final mark.
