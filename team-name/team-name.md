## The main features

The main features are those that our team will focus on in order to make a deliverable functional. They are broken down into 6 features that are:
* A practical and evolutionary design
* A large cultivable area
* Easy access to arable land
* Automatic watering
* Automatic light management

## Secondary features

The secondary features are the ones we will work on once the main functionalities are operational. They bring only extra comfort to the user. They are broken down into 4 features that are:
* A self-sufficient energy ecosystem
* A clear and complete man / garden interface
* An adaptation to the type of plant
* Automatic moisture adjustment
* Controlled ventilation

Designing a smart garden, autonomous and small become a real need to give back to the citizen to see germinate their own flowers!

With this goal in mind, we began to think about the future of the garden. Its main function will be self-management according to its own needs and conditions. To water when the earth becomes dry, to light the plants when it is too dark, to renew the air when this one is saturated ...

So no one will have any excuses for not putting their hand to the ground!
